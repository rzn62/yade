Open-EFI
=======

Open-EFI  -- yet another opensource ECU system.
we take the best features from rusEFI, DIY-EFI, Megasquirt and improve this.
Our target is lightweight, fast and lowcost ECU.
We are interested in growth in quality, but not growth in volume. We try to use the microcontroller to the full, but not to increase the firmware size.
